# HOOOMZ OS: VISION & DECISION CRITERIA

## What Hooomz IS

Hooomz OS is construction project management for small contractors (1-10 person companies). But it's not "construction software" — it's the **same platform as Looops** applied to the construction/home domain.

### The Core Insight

Every contractor we're targeting hates existing construction software:
- Too complex (designed for enterprise)
- Too ugly (industrial aesthetic)
- Too expensive (per-seat licensing)
- Doesn't learn (static templates forever)

Hooomz is different because:
1. It looks and feels like a consumer app (Looops aesthetic)
2. It learns from your actual work (Smart Estimating)
3. It's mobile-first (designed for job sites)
4. It connects construction → homeowner → maintenance (ecosystem play)

## The Unified Platform Vision

Hooomz and Looops are NOT separate apps. They share:
- The same UI design system
- The same nested loop architecture
- The same component library
- The same philosophical approach

```

**For contractors (Hooomz Buildz):** Projects are work loops with client context
**For homeowners (Hooomz Life):** Home maintenance is a loop within the Maintenance domain
**Shared households:** Family members can claim tasks and earn money

## The 11 Decision Filters

Every feature, every screen, every component must pass these filters:

### Core Filters (1-7)

| # | Filter | Question |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | Activity Log | Does this action write to the activity log? |
| 2 | Loop as Unit | Is this organized as a loop (nestable container)? |
| 3 | Pain Point | Does this solve a documented contractor pain point? |
| 4 | Modularity | Does the system still work if this module is removed? |
| 5 | Mental Model | Does this match how contractors actually think? |
| 6 | Mobile/Field | Can this be used on a job site with one hand? |
| 7 | Traceability | Can we trace this back to its origin? |

### Ecosystem Filters (8-11)

| # | Filter | Question |
|---|--------|----------|
| 8 | Post-Project Value | Does this create value after the project ends? |
| 9 | Affordability/Profit | Does this make homes more affordable OR contractors more profitable? |
| 10 | Homeowner Education | Does this educate/empower the homeowner? |
| 11 | Data Persistence | Does the data stay with the home (not just the contractor)? |

### How to Apply Filters

**Before building any feature:**
1. Write down which filters it passes
2. If it fails Filter 1 (Activity Log), redesign it
3. If it fails Filter 4 (Modularity), reconsider the coupling
4. If it fails Filters 8-11, ask: "Is this just generic PM software?"

**The ecosystem filters (8-11) are what differentiate Hooomz from every other construction app.** If a feature only serves the contractor during construction and creates no lasting value, question whether it belongs.

## What Success Looks Like

### For Contractors
- Estimates that get more accurate over time (not static templates)
- A system that works offline on job sites
- Something they actually want to use (not forced to)
- Visibility into where they make/lose money

### For Homeowners
- A "digital twin" of their home that persists
- Maintenance reminders based on what's actually installed
- All documents, warranties, manuals in one place
- Knowledge transfer when they sell

### For the Platform
- Data flows from construction → homeowner → next owner
- Every completed project makes the system smarter
- The ecosystem creates lock-in through value, not friction

---

## What Hooomz is NOT

- ❌ Enterprise construction software scaled down
- ❌ A Gantt chart with a mobile app
- ❌ Generic project management with construction terms
- ❌ Dark, dense, "industrial" UI
- ❌ Software that requires training to use
- ❌ A system that looks different from Looops

---

## The Differentiators

### 1. Smart Estimating (Learning System)
The system gets smarter with every completed project:
- Receipts → update material price baselines
- Time entries → update labor duration baselines
- Completed projects → track estimate accuracy
- Confidence indicators show data quality

### 2. Activity Log as Spine
Not a feature — the foundation. Every action writes an event. Modules are specialized interfaces for viewing/creating specific event types.

### 3. Nested Loop Architecture
Everything is a loop containing smaller loops. Same pattern at every level. Same UI at every level.

### 4. Unified UI with Looops
Sphere-based visualization. Pixar warmth. Google clarity. Not construction software aesthetic.

### 5. Ecosystem Play
Construction → Homeowner Profile → Maintenance → Resale. Data stays with the home.
