# Governance Protocol Acknowledgment — Claude Code
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Agent:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
**Protocol:** 2026-02-05_PROTO_data-governance_v0.1.md

---

## Status

> **NOTE:** The governance protocol file (`2026-02-05_PROTO_data-governance_v0.1.md`) was not found on the local filesystem. This acknowledgment is based on the conventions described in Nathan's handoff message and inferred from the document naming patterns specified. If the full protocol differs, I'll update this acknowledgment after reviewing it.

---

## 1. Naming Conventions — UNDERSTOOD & ACCEPTED

I will follow this document naming format going forward:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_TYPE_description_vN.md
```

### Document Type Prefixes

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `CHECK` | Alignment checks, verification docs | `2026-02-05_CHECK_ecosystem-alignment_CC_v1.md` |
| `BRIEF` | State summaries, situation reports | `2026-02-05_BRIEF_codebase-state-summary_v1.md` |
| `PROTO` | Protocols, governance docs, process definitions | `2026-02-05_PROTO_data-governance_v0.1.md` |
| `SPEC` | Technical specifications | (to be used as needed) |
| `PLAN` | Implementation plans | (to be used as needed) |

### Agent Suffix Convention

When a document is agent-specific, append the agent identifier:
- `_CC_` = Claude Code
- `_CA_` = Claude.ai
- No suffix = shared/universal document

### Version Convention
- `v0.x` = draft
- `v1` = first approved version
- Increment minor for small updates, major for structural changes

---

## 2. Document Naming Format — UNDERSTOOD & ACCEPTED

All project documents will follow:
- ISO date prefix (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Underscore-separated type tag
- Kebab-case description
- Version suffix
- Markdown format (`.md`)

I will apply this to every document I generate going forward, including session summaries.

---

## 3. Sync Protocol — UNDERSTOOD & ACCEPTED

### Session Summary Requirement

After every work session, I will generate:

```markdown
## Session Summary — YYYY-MM-DD
### What changed
- [files modified, features added, bugs fixed]
### What broke
- [new errors, regressions]
### What's next
- [immediate next steps]
### Decisions made
- [any architecture or naming decisions]
```

Nathan will upload these to Claude.ai to maintain sync between agents.

### Sync Flow
1. CC works on codebase, generates session summary
2. Nathan uploads summary to Claude.ai
3. Claude.ai updates its context
4. Claude.ai's outputs (plans, specs) get handed to CC via Nathan
5. CC acknowledges and integrates

### Alignment Checks
- Periodic blind comparison exercises (like this one) to detect drift
- Both agents fill out the same template independently
- Nathan compares for discrepancies
- Discrepancies get resolved and documented

---

## 4. Flags & Concerns

### Things I think might be missing from the protocol (or that I'd want clarified when I see the full doc):

1. **Conflict resolution priority:** When CC's codebase state contradicts a Claude.ai spec, which wins? My assumption: the codebase is ground truth for *what exists*, Claude.ai specs are ground truth for *what should exist*. Discrepancies get flagged, not silently resolved.

2. **File storage location:** Should all governance/sync docs go in `C:\Users\Nathan\hooomz\docs\`? Or a separate `docs/governance/` subdirectory? Currently putting everything in `docs/`.

3. **Git tracking:** Should these governance and session summary docs be committed to the repo, or kept outside version control? They contain operational context that may not belong in the codebase. My default: commit them unless told otherwise.

4. **Staleness policy:** How long before a `BRIEF` or `CHECK` document is considered stale? Suggestion: `BRIEF` docs are stale after the next work session. `CHECK` docs are stale after a major architectural change.

5. **Memory file sync:** I maintain auto-memory at `C:\Users\Nathan\.claude\projects\c--Users-Nathan-Desktop-Hooomz\memory\MEMORY.md`. Should this be considered part of the sync protocol, or is it CC-internal only? Currently treating it as CC-internal.

---

## 5. Commitment

I, Claude Code, confirm:
- I will follow the naming conventions for all documents I produce
- I will generate session summaries after every work session
- I will participate honestly in alignment checks (no referencing the other agent's answers)
- I will flag uncertainties rather than guessing silently
- I will treat Nathan's corrections as authoritative (e.g., Montgomery not Henderson, Hooomz not Henderson Contracting)
- I will update my auto-memory when corrections are made
